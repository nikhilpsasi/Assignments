/*Given a number n, determine whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a
number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples :

Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.

Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.

Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered
prime.
